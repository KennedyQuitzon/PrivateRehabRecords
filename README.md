## üìã Overview

This application revolutionizes how rehabilitation and sports medicine data is managed by providing a secure, blockchain-based platform where patient privacy is guaranteed through advanced cryptographic techniques. Medical professionals can track patient progress while ensuring sensitive health information remains completely confidential.

## üîë Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Contract

The system leverages Zama's FHE technology to enable computation on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

- **Encrypted Data Processing**: Medical records remain encrypted even during analysis and updates
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Healthcare providers can work with patient data without seeing raw values
- **On-Chain Confidentiality**: Sensitive metrics are stored on the blockchain in encrypted form
- **Secure Computation**: Statistical analysis and comparisons happen on encrypted data

### Confidential Sports Medicine Data

The application manages highly sensitive rehabilitation and sports medicine information including:

- **Exercise Intensity Metrics**: Encrypted tracking of workout intensity levels (0-100 scale)
- **Pain Assessment**: Confidential pain level monitoring (0-10 scale)
- **Mobility Scores**: Private mobility and range-of-motion measurements
- **Exercise Type Classification**: Categorized rehabilitation activities (strength, cardio, flexibility, balance, coordination)
- **Session Duration Tracking**: Encrypted time-based progress monitoring
- **Therapist-Patient Relationships**: Secure assignment and access control

All data points are encrypted using FHE, ensuring that even blockchain validators cannot see the actual values.

## üè• Key Features

### For Healthcare Providers (Therapists)

- **License-Based Authorization**: Therapists must be authorized with verified license numbers
- **Patient Registration**: Securely register and assign patients
- **Encrypted Record Creation**: Create detailed rehabilitation records with full privacy
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track patient progress over time while maintaining confidentiality
- **Session Management**: Record and analyze therapy sessions

### For Patients

- **Privacy Guaranteed**: All medical data is encrypted and only accessible to authorized therapists
- **Treatment History**: View your rehabilitation journey and progress
- **Secure Access**: Control who can access your medical records
- **Transparent Care**: Understand your treatment timeline and assigned healthcare providers

### System Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate permissions for patients, therapists, and administrators
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-based storage ensures data integrity
- **Deactivation Capability**: Records can be marked inactive while preserving history
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency of who accessed what data and when

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Sports Injury Rehabilitation**: Track athlete recovery with complete privacy
2. **Physical Therapy Clinics**: Manage multiple patients with secure, encrypted records
3. **Occupational Therapy**: Monitor workplace injury recovery confidentially
4. **Post-Surgical Rehabilitation**: Track recovery metrics without privacy concerns
5. **Chronic Pain Management**: Long-term tracking of pain levels and treatment efficacy
